# Supply and Demand Game!

This is a game implemented in C# based off of the GTA Chinatown Wars' merchandise buying/selling game! It includes all of the merchandise from the original game, as well as factors such as heat and respect that can affect how the game is played. There are plans to implement deeper features such as missions and an upgrades store, but these may be out of my league.

## Cool Things About This Project

This project is 100% a vanity project, and is unlikely to ever materialise into a fun game, that being said, it has some cool things.

- No game engine was used, the UI was made entirely within WPF
- Icons straight from the game
- Easy to modify code for better developers
- Can be modified for less nefarious market games

## Why?

This was originally done as a little pet project, but eventually became a bit of an obsession. I am happy to say I learnt a lot from this!

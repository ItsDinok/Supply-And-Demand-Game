### Supply and Demand Game!

This is a game implemented in C# based off of the GTA Chinatown Wars' merchandise buying/selling game!

## Cool Things About This Project

This project is 100% a vanity project, and is unlikely to ever materialise into a fun game, that being said, it has some cool things.

- No game engine was used, the UI was made entirely within WPF
- Icons straight from the game
- Easy to modify code for better developers
